    "## Introduction to the Lorenz System\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lorenz System, named after Edward Lorenz, is a set of three ordinary differential equations first used in the study of atmospheric convection. Edward Lorenz was a meteorologist and a mathematician at MIT who is best known for his pioneering contributions to a field of mathematics known as chaos theory. In short, chaos theory is a branch of mathematics dedicated to the study of dynamic systems whose behavior is totally deterministic, but extrodinarily hard to predict due to an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions of the system. Lorenz is also known for coining the term \"butterfly effect\" which he used to reference both the geometrical shape of the so-called Lorenz attractor which is pictured above, and as a metaphor Lorenz popularized to describe chaotic systems (you may have heard about a butterfly flapping it's wings in China causing a hurricane in the United States). Today we will use __odeint__ to solve the Lorenz System, and at the end of the notebook we will reproduce our own Lorenz attractor!"

    "## STEP 1: Identifying Paramaters and State Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: If you already feel comfortable interpreting differential equations, feel free to skip this section and move directly to step 2.*\n",
    "___\n",
    "The first step to solving a system of differential equations using python and odeint is to identify which symbols in our equations correspond to state variables, and which symbols correspond to parameters. The number of state variables is always equal to the number of equations in the system but the number of parameters can vary depending on the situation we are studying. When presented with a system of differential equations, an easy way to identify the state variables is to look at the expressions on the left-hand side of the equation. If you see a derivative expression like $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ then you know that $y$ is a state variable for the whole system. In practice, you may first have to do some algebraic manipulations of your equations so that you get all of your derivative expressions on the left-hand side and everything else on the right-hand side. Once you have identified all of the state variables for the system, the remaining symbols on the right-hand side of the equations correspond to parameters. Let's take a look at a few basic examples we have already encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = y.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This (single equation) system presents us the simplest possible case. We have one equation, and therefore one state variable, $y$. Since there are no other symbols on the right-hand side, we see that this system has zero parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\alpha x.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This (single equation) system was used earlier in the course as a simple model of a viral population. In this model we still have just one equation and therefore we have just one state variable, $x$. However, we still have one symbol, $\\alpha$, remaining on the right-hand side of the equation. This remaining symbol must be a parameter so that in this example, our system contains one equation, one state variable, and one parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a slightly more complicated system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = y -\\alpha x.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\beta y.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to emphasize for a second that there is a just one single set of state variables, and one single set of parameters for the entire system of equations. If you only look at  the first equation, you may be tempted to say that $y$ is a parameter for the system, but this is not the case. Since we see $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ on the left-hand side of the second equation, we know that $y$ must be a state variable for the entire system of equations. Since we also see $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ on the left-hand side of the first equation, we know that $x$ must the other state variable for our two equation system. Now, we are left with two remaining symbols on the right hand side, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, so these must be our parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have had some review, let's take a look at the Lorenz System and try to identify the parameters and state variables. Remember that the Lorenz system of equations looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sigma (y-x),$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have parsed our mathematical equations, we are ready to define our derivative equation in python. Every derivative equation we use in this course can be roughly broken down into the same five-part structure: inputs, state variables, parameters, differential equations, and outputs. All derivative functions will start out with a function definition containing two inputs: a state vector and a time. The state vector will be a list object that contains a numerical value for each of our state variables, and the time will also be a numerical value, measured in seconds, hours, days, etc. depending on our situation. We will prepare an initial state vector as a starting input for our derivative function in the next step. In the remainder of our derivative function, we define our inputs by unpacking the state vector using python's list indexing, and choose constant values for our parameters. Then we will define our differential equations and finally, output all of those differential equations. Every derivative function should have a list of outputs containing one derivative for each state variable in the system.\n",

If you are interested in exploring the model further, try playing with the initial conditions in our initial state vector. You can also try changing the values of the parameters in the derivatives function. As it turns out, $\\rho$ is usually the most interesting parameter. Try setting the $\\rho$ parameter to 100.50 or 99.65 to see some interesting behavior in the state-space. These values for $\\rho$ no longer give rise to a chaotic solution to the system.
